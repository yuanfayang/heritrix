        <p>Heritrix is the Internet Archive's open-source, extensible, 
        	web-scale, archival-quality web crawler project.</p>
        	
        <p><em>Heritrix</em> (sometimes spelled <em>heretrix</em>, or 
        misspelled or missaid as <em>heratrix</em>/<em>heritix</em>/
        <em>heretix</em>/<em>heratix</em>) is an 
        archaic word for <em>heiress</em> (woman who inherits). Since our 
        crawler seeks to collect and <i>preserve</i> the digital
        artifacts of our culture for the benefit of future researchers and
        generations, this name seemed apt.</p>

        <p>Heritrix is designed to respect the
        <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html">robots.txt</a>
        exclusion directives and 
        <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html#meta">META robots
        tags</a>, and collect material at a measured, adaptive pace unlikely
        to disrupt normal website activity.

        09/14/2006">
      <p>
      The Deduplicator is a add-on module for Heritrix that allows sequential
      snapshot crawls to leverage information about previous iterations to avoid
      storing (or even downloading) duplicate data.  See the 
      <a 
      href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/3282">
      mailing list announcement</a> for details.

      <p>Release 1.6.0 offers improved remote control and monitoring via
      JMX, a crawl-checkpointing facility, and experimental support for bloom
      filter already-included testing, partitioning a crawl across multiple

      reported bugs. See
