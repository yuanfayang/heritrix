##
## This configuration file allows you to define environment variables
## to be shared between Heritrix shell scripts.  Note, to use these
## this file will need to be in the root directory of your Heritrix
## tree, and you will need to set the environment variable 
## CRAWL_HOME (I suggest using your .bash_profile or the like)
##


## path to java home (not java executible)
export JAVA_HOME=<PUT_JAVA_HOME_HERE>


## path to ant (for builds)
export ANT_HOME=<PUT ANT HOME HERE>

## do you want to use authenticated CVS?  If so uncomment
#CVS_RSH=ssh
