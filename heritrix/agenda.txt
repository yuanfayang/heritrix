Recently done:
CrawlURI instantiation
import AList
basic politeness
simple http fetcher
simple link extractor

Next few things to do:
make HTTPfetcher threadsafe (perhaps by having an instance per thread)
integrate ARCwriter
mercator-style progress log ("timings"?)
create document of Alist keys/conventions
ToeThread start/pause/stop cleanup
VirtualBuffer (chained buffer, etc.) impl & cleanup
link markup conventions
