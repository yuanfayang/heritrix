Recently done:
CrawlURI instantiation
import AList
basic politeness
simple http fetcher
simple link extractor
make HTTPfetcher threadsafe (perhaps by having an instance per thread)

Next few things to do:
get to the bottom of HTTPClient "Recoverable exceptions" 
implement Filters
integrate ARCwriter (HTTP + DNS)
collect better stats on system state (pending URIs, etc.) and progress (raw bytes, URI results)
mercator-style progress log ("timings"?)
create document of Alist keys/conventions
ToeThread start/pause/stop cleanup
VirtualBuffer (chained buffer, etc.) impl & cleanup
link markup conventions
