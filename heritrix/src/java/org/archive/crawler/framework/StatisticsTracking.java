/**
 * An interface for objects that want to collect statistics on
 * running crawls. An implementation of this is referenced in the
 * crawl order and loaded when the crawl begins.
 *
 * <p>It will be given a reference to the relevant CrawlController.
 * The CrawlController will contain any additional configuration
 * information needed.
 *
 * <p>Any class that implements this interface can be specified as a
 * statistics tracker in a crawl order.  The CrawlController will
 * then create and initialize a copy of it and call it's start()
 * method.
 *
 * <p>This interface also specifies several methods to access data that
 * the CrawlController or the URIFrontier may be interested in at
 * run time but do not want to have keep track of for themselves.
 * {@link org.archive.crawler.framework.AbstractTracker AbstractTracker}
 * implements these. If there are more then one StatisticsTracking
 * classes defined in the crawl order only the first one will be
 * used to access this data.
 *
 * <p>It is recommended that it register for
 * {@link org.archive.crawler.event.CrawlStatusListener CrawlStatus} events and
 * {@link org.archive.crawler.event.CrawlURIDispositionListener CrawlURIDisposition}
 * events to be able to properly monitor a crawl. Both are registered with the
 * CrawlController.
