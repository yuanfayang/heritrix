/**
 * An output stream that records all writes to wrapped output
 * stream.
 *
 * A RecordingOutputStream can be wrapped around any other
 * OutputStream to record all bytes written to it.  You can
 * then request a ReplayInputStream to read those bytes.
 *
 * <p>The RecordingOutputStream uses an in-memory buffer and
 * backing disk file to allow it to record streams of
 * arbitrary length limited only by available disk space.
 *
 * <p>As long as the stream recorded is smaller than the
 * in-memory buffer, no disk access will occur.
 *
 * <p>Recorded content can be recovered as a ReplayInputStream
 * (via getReplayInputStream() or, for only the content after
 * the content-begin-mark is set, getContentReplayInputStream() )
 * or as a ReplayCharSequence (via getReplayCharSequence()).
 *
 * <p>This class is also used as a straight output stream
 * by {@link RecordingInputStream} to which it records all reads.
 * {@link RecordingInputStream} is exploiting the file backed buffer
 * facility of this class passing <code>null</code> for the stream
 * to wrap.  TODO: Make a FileBackedOutputStream class that is
 * subclassed by RecordingInputStream.
