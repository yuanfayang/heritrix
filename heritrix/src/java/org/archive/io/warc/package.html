<body>
Experimental WARC Writer and Readers.  Code and specification subject to change
with no guarantees of backward compatibility: i.e. newer readers
may not be able to parse WARCs written with older writers. This package
contains prototyping code for revision 0.12 of the WARC specification.
Version 0.10 code and its documentation has been moved into the
<a href="v10/package.html">v10</a> subpackage.


<h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>Initial implementations of <code>Arc2Warc</code> and <code>Warc2Arc</code>
tools can be found in the package above this one, at
{@link org.archive.io.Arc2Warc} and {@link org.archive.io.Warc2Arc}
respectively.  Pass <code>--help</code> to learn how to use each tool.
TODO: Fix these tools to point at v12.
