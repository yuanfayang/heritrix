Parsers and Writers for the (expired) Internet-Draft <a 
href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/ark/anvlspec.pdf">A Name-Value
Language (ANVL)</a>.  Use {@link ANVLRecord} to create new instances
of ANVL Records and for parsing.

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p>The ANVL Internet-Draft of 14 February, 2005 is inspecific as to the
definition of 'blank line' and 'newline'.  This parser implementation
assumes <code>CRNL</code>.
</p>

<p>Specification allows for CR, NL, or CRNL in a 'data element' <i>label</i>.
This implementation currently fails on such labels. Here is RFC822:
<pre>
     field       =  field-name ":" [ field-body ] CRLF
     
     field-name  =  1*<any CHAR, excluding CTLs, SPACE, and ":">
     
     field-body  =  field-body-contents
                    [CRLF LWSP-char field-body]
     
     field-body-contents =
                   <the ASCII characters making up the field-body, as
                    defined in the following sections, and consisting
                    of combinations of atom, quoted-string, and
                    specials tokens, or else consisting of texts>
</pre>
