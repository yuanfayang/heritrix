            alt="Heritrix Cluster Controller Logo" /> This page describes how to setup
            and run this <b>Heritrix Cluster Controller</b> web application.  This
            webapp must be configured to point to the same JNDI Service Provider
            all members of a Heritrix cluster are pointing to.  This will usually require
            adding a <code>jndi.properties</code> specification and any needed
            client JARs to the CLASSPATH of the hcc webapp. Once up and running,
            hcc will list all cluster members, report basic stats on the cluster as a whole
            and allow execution of cluster-wide operations.</p>

          	<h2>JNDI Service Provider</h2>
          	
          	<p>This web application expects a <code>jndi.properties</code>
          	on the CLASSPATH that holds specification of the JNDI Service Provider to use.
          	Usually the provider will be external.  Because Tomcat has its own local
          	JNDI provider and it doesn't seem possible to make a Tomcat webapp use
          	other than the container's JNDI Provider, this webapp will not work under
          	Tomcat (TODO: Look at if its possible for external applications to use
          	Tomcat's JNDI.  I think I read this is not possible).</p>
          	
          	<p>This webapp will work in Jetty.  Unjar the webapp WAR file and 
          	put a <code>jndi.properties</code>
          	configured to point at the external JNDI provider into the
          	<code>hcc/WEB-INF/classes</code> directory so its on the hcc webapp
          	CLASSPATH (Doesn't have to be here but this seems easiest way of
          	adding webapp scoped elements to CLASSPATH).  Add any necessary
          	client JARs to the CLASSPATH: e.g. by putting them in
          	<code>hcc/WEB-INF/lib</code>. Restart.
          	</p>
          	
          	<p>This webapp will also work in JBOSS.  If using a JBOSS JNP JNDI
          	Service Provider, then, just drop this webapp into JBOSS and it will
          	deploy reading the local JBOSS JNP instance; no need to mess with
          	any jndi.properties (If using JNP, see JNDIView MBean to get listings
          	on the JNDI content).</p>
