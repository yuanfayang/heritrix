    <subsection name="Java Runtime Environment">
<p>The Heritrix crawler is implemented purely in java.  This means that the
only true requirement for running it is that you have a JRE installed.  The
Heritrix crawler makes use of 1.4 features so your JRE must be at least
of a 1.4.0 pedigree.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Ant and Maven">
<p>You can build Heritrix from source using Ant or Maven.  The Maven build is
more comprehensive and will generate all from either the packaged source or
from a CVS checkout.  The Ant build is less so in that they doesn't generate
the distribution documentation but it does produce all else needed to run
Heritrix.</p>
<p>
If you are building Heritrix w/ Ant, you must have Ant 1.5 installed.  If you
want to run the Heritrix unit tests from Ant, you will have to make sure the
Ant optional.jar file sits beside the junit.jar.  See
http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/junit.html for what you must do
setting up Ant to run junit tests.
</p>
<p>The Heritrix maven build was developed using 1.0-rc1.  See maven.apache.org.
</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Linux">
        <p>The Heritrix crawler has been built and tested on Linux only. 
        We'll eventually get to other platforms but thats all that we're run
        on to date.</p>
