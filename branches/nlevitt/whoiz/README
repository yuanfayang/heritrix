How to build?

  * from tarball: ./configure && make && sudo make install
  * from svn: ./autogen.sh && make && sudo make install

  See also the file INSTALL.

Why another whois client?

  1. Apache license
  2. Recursive lookup starting with whois.iana.org
  3. Support for whois:// URLs

  When I started working on the whois fetcher for Heritrix I went looking for
  some existing code to base it on. But the existing clients were all GPL, and
  Heritrix is now mostly Apache licensed. So I started from scratch.

  Existing whois clients mostly have lists of servers for different TLDs and
  such. But it turns out that today only a small handful of servers need to be
  hardcoded, because you can lookup TLDs at whois.iana.org, and it will refer
  you to a more specific server. 

  In addition, this whois client supports whois://{server}/{query} URLs, a
  scheme I invented for Heritrix.

  Note: as of this writing, the whois fetcher is not yet included in Heritrix.
