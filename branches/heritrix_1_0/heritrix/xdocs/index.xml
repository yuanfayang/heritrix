    <section name="Introduction">
        <p>Heritrix is the Internet Archive's open-source, extensible, 
        	web-scale, archival-quality web crawler project.</p>
        	
        <p><em>Heritrix</em> (sometimes spelled <em>heretrix</em>, or 
        misspelled or missaid as <em>heratrix</em>/<em>heritix</em>/
        <em>heretix</em>/<em>heratix</em>) is an 
        archaic word for <em>heiress</em> (woman who inherits). Since our 
        crawler seeks to collect and <i>preserve</i> the digital
        artifacts of our culture for 
        the benefit of future researchers and generations, this name 
        seemed apt.</p>

    <section name="Webmasters!">
        <p>Heritrix is designed to respect the
        <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html">robots.txt</a>
        exclusion directives and 
        <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html#meta">META robots
        tags</a>, and collect material at a measured, adaptive pace unlikely
        to disrupt normal website activity.

        <p>Release (and branch heritrix-0_8 made at the heritrix-0_7_1 tag)

        publically available, incorporated integration selftest into build,
        made it a maven-build only (ant-build no longer supported), added
        day/night configurations (refinements), ameliorated too-many-open
        files, added exploit of http-header content-type charset creating
        character streams, and heritrix now crawls ssl sites. UI improvements
        include red start by bad configuration, precompilation, and
        delineation of advanced settings.
