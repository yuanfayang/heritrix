<h2>Axioms and Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Classes that can be configured export their configuration including
    defaults, allowed values, etc.
    <li>Registry implementation can be swapped out and an alternate used
	just by changing system property.
	<ul>
		<li>TODO: Do same for serialization.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
    </li>
    <li>Components have name and type.  For now, assumption is that I'm passed
    classname as type.</li>
</ul>

<h2>TODOs</h2>
<ul>
    <li>How to do Notifications?  Invocation of Operations? For former seems
	easy enough.  Component updates its config.   Config. sends out
	notifications.  For invocations, then config. needs reference to
	Component -- somehow.
    </li>
</ul>
