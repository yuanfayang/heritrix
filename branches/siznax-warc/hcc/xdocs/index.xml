    <p>The Heritrix Cluster Controller (hcc) is a set of packages that enable control
    of a cluster of <a href="http://crawler.archive.org/">heritrix</a> instances
    running across multiple machines. There are two main components - the controller
    itself and a client API for accessing the component. The controller itself is
    essentially a facade with a DynamicMBean interface.  Internally it effectively
    finds all heritrix resources in a JNDI scope and then proxies all communication
    to them.  It provides a set of attributes and methods which perform the general
    functions of finding, listing, and invoking operations on single remote instances
    or groups of them.  The client serves to translate the generic MBean interface
    into an easy to use domain specific interface thus simplying the work of
    programmers interested in building application specific extensions without
    having to deal with a generic JMX OpenDynamicMBean interface.  To download
    latest binary, see under the <i>Build Artifacts</i> link of this page up on
    our <a href="http://builds.archive.org:8080/cruisecontrol/buildresults/HEAD-hcc">continuous build server</a>.  For how to get started using hcc, see
