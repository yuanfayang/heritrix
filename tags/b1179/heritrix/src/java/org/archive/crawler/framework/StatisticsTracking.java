 * An interface for objects that want to collect statistics on

 * crawl order and loaded when the crawl begins.
 * <p>
 * It will be given a reference to the relevant CrawlController. 
 * The CrawlController will contain any additional configuration
 * information needed.
 * <p>
 * Any class that implements this interface can be specified as a 
 * statistics tracker in a crawl order.  The CrawlController will
 * then create and initialize a copy of it and call it's start() 
 * method.
 * <p>
 * It is recommended that it register for {@link org.archive.crawler.event.CrawlStatusListener CrawlStatus} events and
 * {@link org.archive.crawler.event.CrawlURIDispositionListener CrawlURIDisposition} events to be able to properly monitor a
 * crawl. Both are registered with the CrawlController.
