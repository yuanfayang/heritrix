<body>
	Contains classes that the web UI uses to monitor and control crawls.
<p>
	This is done via a CrawlJobHandler that does most of the heavy duty work
	of interfacing with the CrawlController. The CrawlJob class serves to
	encapsulate the settings needed to launch one crawl. 
</p>
<p>
	This package also provides an implementation of the Statistics Tracking
	interface that contains useful methods to access progress data. This is
	used for monitoring crawls.
