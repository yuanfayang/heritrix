    <subsection name="Java Runtime Environment">
<p>The Heritrix crawler is implemented purely in java.  This means that the
only true requirement for running it is that you have a JRE installed.  The
Heritrix crawler makes use of 1.4 features so your JRE must be at least
of a 1.4.0 pedigree.</p>
    </subsection>
   
    <subsection name="Linux">
        <p>The Heritrix crawler has been built and tested on Linux only. 
        We'll eventually get to other platforms but thats all that we've run
        on to date.</p>
