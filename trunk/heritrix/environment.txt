## This configuration file allows you to define environment variables
## to be shared between Heritrix shell scripts.  Note, to use these
## this file will need to be in the root directory of your Heritrix
## tree, and you will need to set the environment variable 
## CRAWL_HOME (I suggest using your .bash_profile or the like)

ANT_HOME=/0/cvs_webcrawler_nightly_build/CrawlerTesting/utils/Ant/apache-ant-1.5.2
