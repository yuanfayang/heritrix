<body>Provides the client-side aspect of the heritrix integration self test. 
    <p>The <i>garden</i> webapp is the repository for the serverside of the 
    intergration test.</p> <p>The integration self test is run from the command 
    line. Invocation makes the crawler go up against itself trawling the 
    <i>garden</i> webapp. When done, the product -- arc and log files -- are 
    analyzed by code herein to verify test pass or fail.</p> <p>The integration 
    self test is the aggregation of multiple individual tests each testing a 
    particular crawler aspect. For example, the <i>Robots</i> test validates 
    the crawler's parse of <i>robots.txt</i>. Each test comprises a directory 
    under the <i>garden</i> webapp named for the test into which we put the 
    server pages that express the scenario to test, and a class that subclasses 
    <code>org.junit.TestCase</code> from this package named for the webapp 
    directory w/ a <code>SelfTest</code> suffix. This class verifies test 
    completion.</p> <p>The first crop of self tests are derived from tests 
    developed by Parker Thompson &rt;pt at . See <a 
    href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/archive-crawler/Tests/">Tests</a>.
