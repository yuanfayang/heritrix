<title>Heritrix - open-source, extensible, web-scale, archival-quality web crawler/title>
</head>

    <h1>Introduction to Heritrix</h1>
    <p>
        Heritrix is designed to be easily extendable via 3rd party modules. 
        
    <h1>Architecture</h1>
    <p>
        The software is divided into several packages of varying importance.
        The relationship between them will be covered in some greater depth
        after their introductions.
    <p>
        The root package (this) contains the executable class
        {@link org.archive.crawler.Heritrix org.archive.crawler.Heritrix}.
        That class will load the crawler, parsing command line arguments.
        If a WUI is to be launched it will launch it. It can also start
        jobs (with or without the WUI) that are specified in command line
        options.
    <h2>{@link org.archive.crawler.framework org.archive.crawler.framework}</h2>
    <p>
        The <tt>framework</tt> package contains most of the core classes
        for running a crawl. It also contains a number of Interfaces for
        extensible items, the implementatations of whom can be found in
        other classes.
    <p>
        Heritrix is in effect divided into two types of classes.
        <ol>
            <li> <em>Core classes</em> - these can often be configured but not 
                 replaced.
            <li> <em>Pluggable classes</em> - these must implment a given interface 
                 or extend a specific class but 3rd parties can introduce their own
                 implementations.
        </ol>
        The framework thus contains a selection of the core classes and a number
        of the Interfaces and base classes for the pluggable classes.

    <h2>{@link org.archive.crawler.admin org.archive.crawler.admin}</h2>
    <p>
        The <tt>admin</tt> package contains classes that are used by the Web UI.
        This includes some core classes and a specific implementation of the 
        <tt>Statistics Tracking</tt> interface found in the <tt>framework</tt>
        package that is designed to provide the UI with information about 
        ongoing crawls.

    <h2>{@link org.archive.crawler.basic org.archive.crawler.basic}</h2>
    <p>
        The <tt>basic</tt> package contains the implementation of several 
        pluggable modules.
