$Id$

This directory holds sources for documentation.  The sources are kept here
rather than under the xdoc directory because the sources are xml; xdoc
processing of the xdoc directory assumes any xml found under the xdoc
directory as xdoc.  The xml sources hereunder are not xdoc.  They are likely
docbook (TODO: Have the build autogenerate the html from the xml source).
