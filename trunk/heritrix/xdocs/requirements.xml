    <subsection name="Java Runtime Environment">
		<p>The Heritrix crawler is implemented purely in java.  This means that 
		the only true requirement for running it is that you have a JRE installed.</p>
		
		<p>The Heritrix crawler makes use of Java 1.4 features so your JRE must 
		be at least of a 1.4.0 pedigree.</p>
		
		<p>We currently include all of the free/open source third-party libraries 
		necessary to run Heritrix in the distribution package, and will continue 
		to do so as long as is practical.</p>
	</subsection>
   
    <subsection name="Hardware">
		<p>We recommend assigning at least 256MB RAM to the Java heap (via the
		"-Xmx256MB" VM argument), which is usually suitable for crawls that range 
		over hundreds of hosts.</p>
	</subsection>
    
    <subsection name="Linux">
        <p>The Heritrix crawler has been built and tested primarily on Linux. 
        It has seen some informal use on Windows 2000 and Windows XP, but
        is not tested, packaged, or supported on platforms other than Linux
        at this time.</p>
